# angular-to-do-list-app
A practice app made with Angular and built using the AGILE methodology!

## App Vision and Goal
I want this to be a very simple to-do list app with the ability to add, edit, and remove to-do items with animations and a clean style / design.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I can create a to-do list item and add it to the to-do list so I can manage all of my tasks for the day.
2. As a user, I can delete a to-do list item so I can remove any unwanted items and slim my to-do list down.
3. As a user, I can edit a to-do list item so I can make some adjustments without having to re-create to-do items and streamline the process of managing my to-dos.
4. As a user, I can view my to-do list so I know what I need to work on for the day!

## App Functionality
### Create To-Do Item
### Delete To-Do Item
### Update To-Do Item

## Extra Functionalities
1. Sign in and out of the app to save user account data
2. Store the to-do list for future uses
3. Have an archive to retreive items deleted by accident
